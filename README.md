# WebTyping

This repo contains KMP project (Kotlin/JS + Kotlin/JVM) which demonstrates typing Markdown text on client and syncing it with server.

## Build && Run

By default, app runs on localhost with port 8080, so make sure it's not busy before running!

Use following command to run both server and client:
- Unix:
    `
    ./gradlew :run
    `
  

- Windows:
  `
  gradlew.bat :run
  `
